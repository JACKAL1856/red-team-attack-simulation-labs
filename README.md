Project Title  
Red Team Attack Simulation Labs

Project Overview  
This repository documents structured Red Team attack simulation exercises conducted in authorized lab environments. The objective of this project is to understand attacker techniques, evaluate common security weaknesses, and analyze how such activities are detected and responded to within an enterprise security context.

The project emphasizes ethical execution, controlled testing, and professional documentation rather than real-world exploitation.

Scope of Activities  
- Reconnaissance and attack surface identification  
- Exploitation fundamentals using controlled frameworks  
- Social engineering and phishing simulation scenarios  
- Basic post-exploitation awareness  
- Security assessment reporting practices  

Key Exercises Performed  
- Network and service reconnaissance  
- Exploitation framework usage (Metasploit fundamentals)  
- Phishing attack simulations in lab environments  
- Social engineering technique analysis  
- Security findings documentation and report creation  

Tools and Technologies  
- Metasploit Framework  
- Nmap and reconnaissance utilities  
- Linux-based testing environments  
- Open-source security testing tools  

Reporting and Documentation  
Emphasis was placed on documenting findings clearly, including:
- Description of identified weaknesses  
- Potential security and business impact  
- High-level remediation recommendations  
- Structured reporting aligned with professional security assessments  

Ethical Disclaimer  
All activities documented in this repository were performed in isolated, authorized lab environments strictly for educational purposes. No testing was conducted against live, production, or unauthorized systems.

Key Learnings  
- Understanding attacker methodology and workflow  
- Awareness of detection and response considerations  
- Importance of responsible disclosure and ethics  
- Value of clear reporting in security engagements  

Future Enhancements  
- Mapping attack techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- Adding blue team detection perspectives  
- Expanding reporting depth and risk classification
